# MinimalDex
This is a Minimal Pokedex app for Android the app supports all 1000+ Pokemon using data from the popular PokeAPI. Currently supporting these features for those Pokemon:

1. Pokemon List
    * Smooth scrolling controls
    * National Dex Numbers
    * List filtering (by name or dex number)
2. Pokemon Details
    * Names
    * Types
    * Sprites (front and back defaults)
    * Flavour Text descriptions
    * Stats
    * Evolutions (Displays evolutions details page)
    * Extra info (Capture Rate and Base Happiness)
    * PokeDex Numbers for each region
    * Moves List
3. Settings
    * System Theme Automatic Switching (can be toggled)
    * Dark Theme Toggle

It's aimed at API versions 21+. The app had been built as a side project in 100% Kotlin using Android Jetpack libraries like Navigation.
Ideally i'd like to migrate this app to Jetpack Compose once it's fleshed out. But it's missing some features of more complex layouts and views as the time of writing.
